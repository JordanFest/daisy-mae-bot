Hi! Daisy Mae here! Great to see you're taking an interest in the Stalk Market!
This is a little tool I built to help you report the stalk price for turnips on your island, and share with all your friends!
I'll automatically report the prices twice a day, based on fluctuations in the stalk market.

Here's some things I can do for you

$talks <Turnip price at current time> - I'll keep a record of your latest turnip price until the next change in the market (Example: $talks 420)
$report - I'll report the stalk market prices directly to you!
$letsTalk - Everyone needs a good chat now and then :)
$thanks - A little thank you message!
"""

empty_report = "Oh no! No one has reported any turnip prices! Maybe you can be the first?"

price_report = "Here are the current turnip prices! \n{}"

error_too_high = "The stalk market isn't THAT good. Maybe try something a bit smaller?"

error_invalid_input ="I only take and report turnip prices. Are you confusing me with someone else?"

lets_talk = "You are a beautiful, lovely person, and you make everyone around you shine!")

thanks_copy = "Thank you for using me for all your stalk market needs! I'm still a little new at this and not quite fully up to speed yet, so let me know if there's anything I can improve on by sending a letter to my assistant, Weava."
